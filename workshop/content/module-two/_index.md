## Introduction
Now that you have implemented the Flutter app, you can move onto initializing your Amplify project.

At this point, you will need to have the Amplify CLI installed on your machine. Once installed, we will initialize Amplify at the root directory of our project, install the Amplify dependencies into our project, and ensure Amplify is properly configured during each run of our app.

## What You Will Learn
* Initialize a new Amplify project from the command line
* Add Amplify as a dependency for your project
* Initialize Amplify libraries at runtime

## Key Concepts
* Amplify CLI – The Amplify CLI allows you to create, manage, and remove AWS services directly from your terminal.
* Amplify Libraries – The Amplify libraries allow you to interact with AWS services from a web or mobile application.
