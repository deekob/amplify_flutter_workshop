In this workshop, you will create a mobile application using AWS Amplify and Flutter. The application will have the capability to create a new user in your Amazon Cognito User Pool and view your current GPS co-ordinates

This tutorial will not require any previous knowledge with AWS or any of its services to follow along. However, there will be some more intermediate concepts covered when working with Flutter and Dart.
