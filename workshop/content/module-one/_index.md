## Introduction
AWS Amplify is a suite of tools that allow developers to build apps quicker by providing easy to use libraries that make it possible to authenticate users, store files, capture analytics events, and much more, with just a few lines of code.

In this module, you'll create and build out the UI of an app. This includes the sign-up flow, and page for XXX.

This module will set the foundation of our app so the following modules can focus on the actual Amplify implementations for the specific category.

## What You Will Learn
* Implement a sign-up and login flow
* Navigation between screens
* Implement a grid of widgets

## Key Concepts
Navigator - This tutorial will be using the Flutter Navigator 2.0, which uses a list of pages to determine which view should be displayed using a declarative implementation.

Callbacks - In order to send data from one object to another, we will be using callbacks for communication. A callback is similar to a function in that it can be passed an argument from the call site, but it executes code elsewhere.
